At the University of Arizona, Elizabeth TA-ed for various Roman art and archaeology courses and was a substitute Latin teacher at a local middle school and high school. Her MA thesis was entitled "Persephone as the Archetypal \'Bride of Hades\': An Examination of Athenian Tragedy, Hellenistic Epigrams, and Classical Vase Painting". </p><p>Elizabeth spent two summers at the AAR: immersing herself in the Summer Program in Archaeology and digging at the Meta Sudans/Palatine Northeast (2007); and as a participant in the Summer Program in Roman Pottery (2008). The following summer took her to the ASCSA for Summer Session I (2009). While writing her doctoral dissertation, "The Iconography of the Athenian Hero in Late Archaic Greek Vase-Painting," Elizabeth has been a Student Associate Member of the ASCSA (Fall 2011), a Visiting Scholar at the University of Arizona (Spring 2012), an Adjunct Professor at the University of Richmond ("Greek and Roman Mythology: Epic," Fall 2012), and a lecturer at The University of Virginia (Spring 2013) teaching a self-designed upper level undergraduate seminar ("Gods and Heroes in the Ancient World").</p><p>When Elizabeth is not in her office or at the library, she is a coach and nationally competitive athlete at a local weightlifting and Crossfit gym.

From 2012 to 2013, he worked as an Adjunct Lecturer of Art History at City College, The City University of New York, teaching courses on Italian Renaissance Art and Architecture and European Baroque and Rococo Art. Eric has frequently lectured at The Cloisters Museum, the medieval branch of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p>Under the direction of Professors Fiorani and Barolsky, Eric plans to continue his studies of Michelangelo and the artist\'s relationship with the Strozzi family. In particular, he is interested in the artworks Michelangelo presents as gifts to the family and how this gesture challenges our preconceived notions of the artist-patron dynamic. Eric is also interested in the application of the digital humanities in art history and plans to develop a digital component to his dissertation. </p>',

Her doctoral dissertation, &ldquo;Sanctity and Satire: St. Joseph and Humor in Northern European Art, ca. 1300-1530,&rdquo; explores comic and satirical iconography in early modern paintings, sculpture, and prints of Saint Joseph. Relying on extant German and French Nativity and Shrovetide plays, late medieval <em>facetiae, fabliaux</em>,<em>Schwankliteratur, </em>and satirical paintings and prints, her work reveals the integral role of humor in establishing St. Joseph as an exemplar of the common man in Germany, the Low Countries, and northeastern France. Her writing and teaching have been supported by fellowships from the Dolores Zohrab Liebmann Fund, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the University of Virginia.</p>',
