    <p>We are pleased to introduce our new visiting faculty member for the 2010-2011 academic year, Katie Baines.

    <p>Katie Baines' paintings share the playful investigation of mapping strange landscapes with the use of decidedly psychedelic colors, patterns, and contours. Familiar forms, such as grass bordering stylized black and blue pools, buffer hot red and yellow-orange striations that could be unsuccessful Venetian blinds, which open up to delicate linear designs. Or an open geode of translucent purples is immersed with foreign shapes that spill out of the nodule. Her works act as records of what she has "brought back" to us to explore and fascinate over.

    <p>Baines earned her MFA from The Ohio State University in 2006. She currently resides in Richmond va and also teaches in the department of art at Virginia Commonwealth University.

    <p>Painting on paper is a much more accessible creative practice than painting on canvas and an important component to the painting program here at U.Va. Highly flexible, water medium on paper takes many forms and directions; from creating studies for larger works as in Judith Linhares gouaches, casual paintings that open the mind to the creative process as in Elena Sisto mixed media pieces, or highly refined works that are a serious end into themselves as in Kathy Muehlemann's watercolors. Not only can a young student use water media on paper to more easily access painting's tradition and discipline, but the approach can be as simple as clearing off the kitchen table for an evening's work session.

        <p>Field Notes is a collaborative group based in upstate New York's Hudson Valley region. Visual artists Robert Capozzi, Lorrie Fredette, Dylan McManus, Laura Moriarty, and Jill Parisi comprise this collective. The artists focus on concepts and issues that relate to the earth and its inhabitants with regard to the temporal, structures, systems, and resources.

        <p>For Ruffin Gallery the group will create a new work through a dynamic installation process, interacting with each other for a compressed duration with guidelines, random sequences and original components. The members are inspired by the geography of the Charlottesville region. Hailing from the Shawangunk Ridge and Catskill Mountain Range, this related yet unique location provides new topics to investigate and countless ways to respond visually.

        <p>    The exhibition of landscape paintings highlights some of the changes, large and small, that have happened to the Charlottesville area and it marks the retirement of Dick Crozier after 36 years of teaching at U.Va. Most of the paintings on display are small ones done on site however the exhibition also includes a few larger studio works.

    <h2>Yi Sheng<br><small>The Miraculous Mandarin</small></h2>

    </p>

        <p>    These are the kinds of experiences that nudge a kind of homesickness in me. New Jersey is where I grew up, but it's not home.

        <p>The question of where that place is and what my fluctuating relationship to "home" might be are the immediate issues that arise. This is the core of my work - the complexities of how we situate our sense of self. What I put forth are the complications and contradictions of the psychology of dislocation. The experience of migration seems to leave me feeling as if I'm constantly straddling two shores, whether it is a physical separation of places, the mental and cerebral remapping of psyches, the linguistic and communicative misfires, or cultural divergences. There's a feeling of permanent impermanence, of never arriving at the destination because both beaches look close but I'm still treading water right in the middle of it all.

        <p>While my larger concerns frequently touch on gender, race, and class, my overall practice is based on personal experiences, many of which result in projects that do not always fit so easily within these thematic parameters. I embrace a mix of video, performance, photography, and object making. Employing a broader set of tools with which to communicate enables an added complexity, sparking conceptual and material connections within each piece and between different works. This way of creating feels natural, perhaps because it reflects the exhaustive range of how our daily experiences are comprised.
