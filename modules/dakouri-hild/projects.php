        <p>Dakouri-Hild's main field project is the House of Kadmos in Thebes, 
        a major palatial center of prehistoric Greece equivalent to Mycenae, 
        Pylos and Knossos. The site, located on central mainland Greece and excavated in the early 1900s, yielded the first evidence for socially stratified society in central Greece. Among the finds are unfinished prestige artifacts highlighting virtuoso craftsmanship and the monopolistic production of elite goods. The building itself, which was decorated with pictorial wall-paintings, is the earliest Mycenaean palace known to date; it features a unique plan and is key to understanding Theban topography and the evolution of palatial architectural design. The associated pottery workshop illuminates the production of everyday commodities (such as plain pottery) under the auspices of the palace. The site also affords glimpses into long-distance trade in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean.
         
        <p>More recently (2011), Dakouri-Hild has undertaken the republication of 
        the Late Bronze Age cemeteries of Thebes (with Vassilis Aravantinos and Yiannis Fappas). As part of this project, she has created a new 
        <a href="#past-projects">Geographic Information System</a> consisting of <a href="#past-projects">Digital Thebes</a> data, plus satellite imagery, historical topographical maps, historical tomb layouts from the old excavations (early 20th c.), photography of relevant tomb finds and an associated database.

        <p>The Digital Thebes project, the pilot phase of which was completed in 2002, aimed at the digital archiving, mapping and visualization of antiquities and sites from Thebes in Boeotia using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and more conventional digitization methods. Based on the pilot project, Dakouri-Hild was able to entertain the value and potential of digital technologies in the dissemination of specialized archaeological knowledge, and to ponder on the ability of digital cultural heritage to bridge the past and the present in the context of a contemporary city.
