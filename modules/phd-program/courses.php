				<h5>Materiality and Early Modern Art </h5>
				<a href="#">Fordham ></a>
				TBD
			</div>

			<div class="clr"></div>

			<p class="small">
				This seminar will engage with the 'materiality' debate in Art History, particularly as it relates to Western Art between roughly 1600 to 1800. Challenging the opticality of Modernism, the ephemerality of the screen, and the textuality of theory, the new emphasis on materiality foregrounds embodied experience and the raw materials of artistic process. This seminar examines key works in the field including work by Michael Baxandall, Rebecca Zorach, Marcia Pointon,and James Elkins. The seminar also encourages students to formulate research topics that will be directly relevant to their own PhD thesis development.
