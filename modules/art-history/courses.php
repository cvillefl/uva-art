				<h5>Art and Film </h5>

			<p class="small">
				Through the 20th and 21st centuries, the relationship between art and film (moving pictures) has been met with equal parts excitement, intrigue, suspicion, and hostility. But why? This wide-ranging introductory seminar examines film as an aesthetic resource, a technological inevitability, and a cultural competitor to art over the last 100 years. Individual units focus on specific art trends (realism, the avant-garde, post-modernism, etc.) in order to develop art-historical tools of analysis to deepen our understanding of the production and reception of film in modern art. Major themes include the role of modernity and technology, nationalism as a form of artistic identity, "art" film criticism, and the importance of gender, race, and sexuality to the intersection of art and film.

			</div>

			<div class="clr"></div>

			<p class="small">
				This lecture course will chart key moments in the history of modern art, from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth century, with a special emphasis on the historical and social dimensions of art practice. Necessarily selective, the narrative developed throughout the course will stress those episodes in the history of art that have proven critical to understanding the story of modern and contemporary art as it developed in the western world. The class lectures will provide a synthetic view of the 20th century, including critical assessment of individual works and broader movements, changes in the production and reception of art, and reasons for the shift from Paris to New York as the home of the "avant-garde." Thematic subtexts will also include avant-gardism as an ideology, the perception and identity of the artist, dialogues and tensions between "high" art and mass culture, and the success and failure of Modernism/s.

				<h5>Art and Science in the Middle Ages</h5>
				<a href="<?php p('ah/faculty'); ?>#ramirez-weaver">Ramirez-Weaver ></a>
				TTH 3:30 - 4:45 CAM 160 
			</div>

			<div class="clr"></div>

			<p class="small">
				During the medieval period, the Christian church exerted a hegemonic influence over all aspects of western medieval and Byzantine life.  When Charlemagne was honored in 800 as the Emperor of the Romans at Saint-Peter's church in Rome, the political implications of a union between church and government were clear.  Power and knowledge relied upon the approval and support of churchmen.  Rather than demonstrate a division between science and the spiritual culture of the middle ages, this unification in Christendom revealed an interpenetration of science and religion that found expression in exceptional works of art.  Recent research has investigated the relationship between sacred and secular aspects of life in the Middle Ages.  In this thematic survey of the kinds of artworks, which express a relationship between scientific and spiritual themes during the medieval period, we will examine objects of fine distinction, illuminated manuscripts, and building sites.   Although the primary focus of this course is upon the development of western medieval Christian intellectual traditions, the myriad contributions of Arabic, Islamic, and Jewish scholars to creative and historic confrontations between science and art are everywhere celebrated.  Investigated topics include medieval alchemy, astronomy, astrology, bestiaries, the construction and use of Books of Hours, calendars, celestial globes, diagrams, encyclopedias, herbals, map making in the Middle Ages, medicine, monstrous races, wandering wombs, and zodiacal synagogue floor mosaics.

				Our seminar will embark on a journey around the Mediterranean with Ibn Jubayr, a twelfth century Spanish Muslim who recorded his experiences during his pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina in remarkably lively and detailed first hand account.  From his shipwreck on the coast of Sicily to his performance of the rituals associated with his visit to Mecca, Ibn Jubayr provides an unusual perspective on the built environment, culture and people he encounters throughout his travels.  We will read the translation of his travels as a class with background lectures provided on the visual culture of the sites he visits, such as Palermo, Damascus, Alexandria and Mecca.  Integrated with our discussion of the twelfth century travels of Ibn Jubayr will be an introduction to digital humanities tools such as <a href="http://www.neatline.org" target="_blank">Neatline</a> and Google Earth which we will use to analyze the history of this critical region and its built environment.

As a group, we will explore the definitions of science and technology as they have changed in response to the needs and work of scientists and architects. We will engage with critical analyses of space in an attempt to answer specific questions: What is the relationship between architecture and science? What constitutes a laboratory? How has this typology changed over time? We will also engage with the larger concepts of "modernity," "progress," and "development" as they relate to science and architecture.

				W 1:00 - 3:30 FHL 208 
			</div>

			<div class="clr"></div>

			<p class="small">
				Late medieval Paris and Prague were united historically and genealogically by ties between the royal families of each city and artistically by the international Gothic style of the year 1400.  In this course, we will survey the transformative era of the 14th and early 15th centuries, examining what the artistic record informs us about patronage, artistic styles, everyday life, science, and courtly culture in the late medieval period. 
			</p>
			<p class="small">
				Beginning with a brief examination of the Capetian court and Louis IX's Sainte-Chapelle (ca. 1248), the seminar explores artistic evidence for the rise of the Valois and the social pressures or transformations which gave rise to masterful manuscripts, ascendant architecture, and intellectual innovation during their dynasty.  A scholarly review of the patronage of Charles V and Jean, Duke of Berry, inter alia, provides an important introduction to key artists of the late medieval period, and focuses class discussion upon major themes of significance for the later middle ages, including courtly culture, lay literacy, the expansion of vernacular literatures, burgher domesticity, university life, mysticism and astrology, and late medieval developments in the liberal arts and theology.
			</p>
			<p class="small">
				Rather than focus exclusively upon the French courts linked to Valois princes, however, this course radically interrogates and reviews the relevance of outlying centers of medieval influence like Prague.  The courtly culture of Prague under Charles IV of France's nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV of Bohemia, and his prodigal progeny, Wenceslas IV, experienced an efflorescence around the year 1400.  The spiritual, intellectual, ideological, and aesthetic aspects of the Beautiful Style will be evaluated, underscoring the pivotal and central place of Prague in the development of European artistic traditions, as the sun set on the fact and fiction, framing conceptions of the medieval world.

				<a href="<?php p('ah/faculty'); ?>#schoenthal">Schoenthal ></a>

			</div>

			<div class="clr"></div>

			<p class="small">
				Although the so-called "Beat Generation" lasted only a short period of time - from the late 1940s through the early 1960s - its effects were wide-spread and immediate. Originally a literary movement, the Beat writers' emphasis on spontaneity, individual freedom, spiritual liberation and subcultural "hipness" was shared by many visual artists of the period. As members of a new oppositional counterculture, writers and artists alike developed innovative aesthetic practices in response to American postwar society. This course will examine alternative art practices of the 1950s from the position of the Beat subculture, situating the work in its (art)historical context. We will discuss the problematic descriptor "beat" as it applied, or didn't apply, to the visual arts. There will also be time devoted to reading and discussing the literature of the Beats.
