The primary purpose of the program is to help students develop their portfolios for admission to graduate school.

		<p>Fellows receive a stipend, research funds, and a private studio space for the year. They participate in an advanced seminar, interact with visiting artists and have a culminating exhibition of their work at year's end. 
		Past Fellows have gone on to the very best graduate programs in studio art including Yale, U.C.L.A., Boston University, the University of Iowa, 
		the San Francisco Art Institute, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Tyler School of Art.</p>
