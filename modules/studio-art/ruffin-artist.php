		<h1>Ruffin Distinguished Artist in Residence</h1>

		<p>The Peter B. and Adeline W. Ruffin Foundation established the Ruffin Distinguished Artist in Residence in 2012. The endowment created an annual teaching position designed to bring artists of significant international stature to the University on a rotating basis. Every year the newly appointed Ruffin Artist in Residence offers unique classes, gives a public lecture and has an exhibit or screening of their work for the university community. Throughout the academic year students have the opportunity to interact directly with the artist through seminars and critiques. </p>
