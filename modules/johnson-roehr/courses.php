        <p><acronym>arth</acronym> 3591 <b>History of the Modern South Asian City</b><br>
        This class explores the history and meaning of the urban experience in South Asia (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) from 1850 to the present.  As a group, we explore nature of urban life and culture; the relationship between the physical city and its inhabitants; the role of urban planning in the creation of the modern state; and the conflicts and congruencies between the “modern global city” and so-called traditional South Asian architecture. 

        <p><acronym>arth</acronym> 4591 <b>Spaces of Science</b><br>
        This seminar is based on a critical review of selected texts, primary sources, and buildings that have helped define the relationship between architecture and science since the late seventeenth century. As a group, we will explore the definitions of science and technology as they have changed in response to the needs and work of scientists and architects. We will engage with critical analyses of space in an attempt to answer specific questions: What is the relationship between architecture and science? What constitutes a laboratory? How has this typology changed over time? We will also engage with the larger concepts of “modernity,” “progress,” and “development” as they relate to science and architecture.

        <p><acronym>arth</acronym> 2559 <b>Modern South Asian Architecture</b><br>
        This course explores the built environment and cultural landscapes of South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) from 1800 to the present day. Primary sources—planning proposals, architectural criticism, case studies—and built works will be used to investigate questions of identity, modernity, tropicalism, industrialization, urbanism, nationalism, and postcolonialism.
