        <p class="small">    Susan Johnson-Roehr specializes in the history of South Asian architecture and astronomy. Her work focuses on the mobility of scientific knowledge in the "global" eighteenth century and the ways in which the built environment and landscape facilitated the production and movement of information between India, Europe, and China. She is currently finishing a book project, Science Made of Stone, which analyzes the roles played 
by the astronomical observatories of Sawai Jai Singh II (c. 1721-1743) in the establishment of scientific/cultural networks in north India.

        <p class="small">Johnson-Roehr holds a Ph.D. in Architecture from the University of Illinois (2011), where her dissertation research was supported by a Fulbright-Hays Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship and a Social Science Research Council International Dissertation Research Fellowship. She comes to University of Virginia via the Rutgers Center for Historical Analysis, where she participated in the "Networks of Exchange" working group, courtesy of a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship in History. 

        <p class="small">Johnson-Roehr's teaching addresses topics of urbanism, modernism, 
and the history of science. At present, she is leading courses on the 
South Asian city, modern Indian architecture, and the history of the 
experimental laboratory.

        <p class="small">An avid architectural photographer, Johnson-Roehr has toted her camera to Russia, India, Europe, and across the United States in pursuit of the perfect shot. In 2012, she was awarded first prize in the "Spirit of Flight" juried photography exhibition at the Seattle Museum of Flight for her photograph of Launch Complex 34 (LC-34), Cape Canaveral. Her most recent photo safari involved an urban trek from LAX to Exposition Park 
as she documented the final leg of the transfer of the Space Shuttle Endeavour from Kennedy Space Center to the California Science Center.
